## Fluid PHP Framework

There are many frameworks out there, but as with anything, most of them are designed according to the developers' specific views and opinions.

These are mine. Probably wrong, but I work well with it, so that's something.

Suggestions are of course very welcome.

## Requirements

PHP 5.4+

## Documentation & More

Documentation (though it probably won't be exhaustive for a while, if ever) will eventually show up at [devvoh.com](http://devvoh.com). For now, consider the github repository the definitive source of information.

## License

Fluid PHP Framework is open-sourced software licensed under the MIT license.
