### TODO

#### For composer
1. Make a package of just the vendor/parable folder contents.
2. Add a script (vendor/parable/build.php, for example) that generates files and folders required for Parable.
    - [ ] public/
    - [ ] public/.htaccess
    - [ ] public/index.php
    - [ ] app/
    - [ ] app/Config.php
    - [ ] app/Routes.php
    - [ ] app/View
    - [ ] app/View/hello.phtml
3. If possible, ask the user what the public folder should be.

#### In general
1. Everything an app would need.
2. In specific:
    - [ ] Repository
    - [ ] Entity/Model
    - [ ] Query
    - [ ] Database
